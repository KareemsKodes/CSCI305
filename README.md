1. Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
Artemis financial is a financial company looking for a secure system to help with interacting with their clients. They wanted to be able to securely transmit, store and verify the authenticity of various files that may contain sensitive data.

2. What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?
I think that I did a good job of using the tools at my disposal to effectively discover various vulnerabilities. I also think I did a good job of ensuring good code quality and error handling. It is important to code securely because, in the modern world, there are more and threats to all of our electronic systems. We need to be vigilant in making sure that every system is as secure as we can make it to protect the information and privacy of everyone who may use these systems. It is also important to ensure that the businesses are not harmed by any sort of security issue. Software security brings value in the fact that it protects the company's clients and reputation. If there was some sort of issue, it could cause people to lose trust in the company and move elsewhere.
 
3. What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?
One thing I found particularly  helpful was practicing using the dependency check tool. Using the tool and looking through the various vulnerabilities and the information about them is a very useful skill to have if I was ever going to actually do any kind of software development.
 
4. How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?
Having multiple layers of security is a great preventative measure that can help protect the information within a system. If the system can only be accessed securely, and then the information within the system is encrypted, then even if someone got past the first layer of security, they would still have trouble extracting anything useful.  In the future, I would look at any other security breaches companies may have faced and I would try to learn what happened and how to prevent issues like that from coming up.
 
5. How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
 I ran a dependency check multiple times as I made the code for the project. This allowed me to track if anything new was introduced as I worked. I also made sure to follow secure coding guidelines and check that my code was compliant with those guidelines.
 
 
6. What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?
The internet is a very helpful tool. I was forced to google about a lot of things that needed to be done for the projects in this course. The book and other course resources were less helpful overall. In the future, I will probably save myself the time and effort and do the research needed my own way so that I can focus more on actually ensuring that I am developing secure code.
 
7.Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?
I would show my implementation of the checksum algorithm and I would also show my use of the dependency check tool. Im sure if I was actually going to try and get a job remotely related to this, I would have more realistic examples, but this is a good place to start. I think the implemenation of any encryption for a system can be very useful.
